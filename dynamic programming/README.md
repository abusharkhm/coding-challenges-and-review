# Dynamic Programming

* [Largest Sum](largest_sum.py)
	* Given an array of n integers, find the consecutive indices that give the largest sum.
	* Runtime: 
* [Longest Increasing Subsequence LIS](longest_increasing_subsequence.py)
	* Given an array of integers, return the longest increasing subsequence.
	* Dynamic programming: turns the problem into a DAG. Runtime O(n^2)
