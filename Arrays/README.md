# Arrays

* [Array Manipulation](arrays/arrayManipulation.py)
    * Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array elements between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the max value in your array.
    * Runtime: O(m+n) where m is the number of operations and n is the number of elements in the array.
* Beautiful Subarrays
    * Return the number of subarrays containing m odd numbers.
    * Runtime: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
* Bone Trousle
    * Given the values of n, k, and b for trips to the store, determine which boxes Papyrus must purchase during each trip. He purchases exactly b boxes, has k boxes availble at the store where each box contains k sticks, wants n sticks total. Outputs one possible solution.
    * Runtime: O(b)?
